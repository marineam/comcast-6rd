This is a collection of stuff I use for setting up IPv6 tunnels via
Comcast's 6RD system. It seems to work for me so far. :-)

The main script of interest is dhclient-exit-hooks.d/comcast-6rd-tunnel
which runs each time dhclient gets an IPv4 address and then sets up the
tunnel as needed (or tears it down if you ifdown eth0). Chances are you
will need to customize it for your own use as it touches some things
beyond just the tunnel like DNS goodies.
